Q9: Find all the orders whose two or more items are canceled but the orders are still in the approved status.

Solution:
```sql
select oh.order_id,COUNT(order_item_seq_id) AS item_count
FROM order_header oh
JOIN order_item oi ON oh.order_id=oi.order_id
where oi.status_id='ITEM_CANCELLED' AND oh.status_id='ORDER_APPROVED' 
GROUP BY oh.order_id having item_count>=2;
```
