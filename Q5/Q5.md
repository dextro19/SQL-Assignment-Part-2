5. In New York, which product has the highest sales?
   
SOLUTION:
```sql
SELECT oi.product_id, sum(oi.quantity) as highest_sales 
from order_item as oi
JOIN order_contact_mech as ocm on oi.order_id = ocm.order_id AND ocm.contact_mech_purpose_type_id='SHIPPING_LOCATION'
JOIN postal_address as pa on ocm.contact_mech_id = pa.contact_mech_id
WHERE pa.city ='New York'
GROUP BY oi.product_id order by highest_sales DESC LIMIT 5;
```
