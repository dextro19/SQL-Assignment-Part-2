1. How many single-item orders were fulfilled from warehouses in the last month?

SOLUTION:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM (
    SELECT oi.order_id
    FROM order_item oi
    JOIN order_item_ship_group oisg ON oisg.order_id = oi.order_id AND oisg.ship_group_seq_id = oi.ship_group_seq_id
    JOIN facility f ON f.facility_id = oisg.facility_id
    JOIN order_status os ON os.order_id = oi.order_id AND os.order_item_seq_id = oi.order_item_seq_id AND 
    os.status_id='ITEM_COMPLETED'
    WHERE f.facility_type_id = 'WAREHOUSE'
      AND oi.status_id = 'ITEM_COMPLETED'
      AND os.status_datetime >= (CURDATE() - INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
    GROUP BY oi.order_id
    HAVING COUNT(oi.order_item_seq_id) = 1
) AS subquery;
