7. On a city-wise basis, what is the analysis of returns?

SOLUTION 1:
```sql
select pa.city , count(rcm.return_id) 
from return_contact_mech as rcm
join postal_address as pa on rcm.contact_mech_id = pa.contact_mech_id
group by pa.city;
```

SOLUTION 2:
```sql
SELECT pa.city, COUNT(distinct ri.return_id) 
from return_item ri 
JOIN order_contact_mech ocm ON ri.order_id=ocm.order_id
JOIN postal_address pa ON pa.contact_mech_id=ocm.contact_mech_id
GROUP BY pa.city;
```
